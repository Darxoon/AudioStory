# AudioStory
*'AudioStory'* &nbsp;is an interactive Story entirely based on audio.

It's completely made by Darxoon and utilizes a text-to-speech api for pronouncing the text. Maybe, I'll add real voice later, however, now, it's not planned.

### Controls

* Navigate through menus with `W` and `S`.
    Press Space to talk to a person or to fight an enemy.
* Press Space while talking to a person to skip their text
* In fights, the enemy will either make a left panned, right panned or centered noise.
    The player then has to dodge in that direction with `A`, `W` or `D` with perfect timing.
    Depending on how well it was timed, the more damage the player makes. 
    If the dodge has failed, you loose health.
* Press `Esc` to open the pause menu. There, press `S` to save and `Q` to quit. 
    Press `Esc` again to resume.

### Development

This is still in development. A release date is not planned.
